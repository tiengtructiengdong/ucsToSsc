# ucsToSsc
An utility to convert Pump It Up's .ucs file to .ssc file for plays in StepF2/StepMania/StepPrime. 

You can edit and compile these source codes; however, you cannot re-distribute the source codes / compiled codes as a public project. 

Language: C++11

How to use the CLI example (ucsToSsc.exe):

- ucsToSsc [input-path] [output-path] [title] [artist] [music-filename] [level]

- ucsToSsc [input-path] [output-path]
    + This input will generate default values for the other parameters, which is NOT recommended.

Changelog:
- 3 May 2020: Add source codes and CLI example
